Implement the MergedOrderedIntStream so that you can pass it multiple OrderedInputStreams with duplicate or overlapping values and it will return the next lowest integer using all streams as the data.
The driver code is in the single test class. Assume the OrderedInputStream can contain millions of integers so loading all the data into memory is not a valid solution. The correct solution streams the data.
